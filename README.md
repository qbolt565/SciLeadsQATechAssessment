## Potential improvements
- Replace user creation work with API based actions rather than UI.  Ivestigated the possibility of this, but couldn't identify how the RequestVerificatioToken was generated.
- Abstract common properties and methods out of Page Objects
- Remove Thread.Sleep in CounterPage.Open()
